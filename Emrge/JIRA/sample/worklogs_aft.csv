The recent updated pod grafana-agent-operator version is the latest 0.35.1 which align with Helm Chart release version. Also, it could manage the lifecycle of agent-0, agent-logs, agent-integration-ds-agent-integratons-deploy. These pods version are limit to 0.26.1 in Flux.  The problematic pod labeled operator version 0-34-1 (means version 0.34.1) but the operator with that version has no longer exist. New agent-operator (0.35.1) create a new pod and label it to 0-35-1 but fail to mount the PV (already occupied by old pod).  I have deleted the old pod (grafana-agent-integrations-deploy-5499b89d-pkl8h) and the issue seems fixed. I think the solution maybe fix the operator version by add ""version: 0.2.4""(the actual release for AppVersion 0.26.1) under chart spec or update other pods version to 0.35.1 in Flux.  ","0.5"

Hi Brody,  Good afternoon.  Legacy AAD integration is deprecated. Microsoft will automatically migrate to the new managed integration starting August 1, 2023. We will update it before Microsoft starts. Managed AAD integration has been applied to DevUat AKS and tested fine. We will apply the same way to ProdDemo AKS. After updating, you need to update the kubectl context and run ""kubelogin conversion-kubeconfig -l azurecli"".(detail steps listed below). Could you advice the appropriate time for us to do the change? We will add the ""RES.Azure.KubeAdmin.Prod"" group to the AKS cluster admin group from Azure AD. This allows AKS clusters to create cluster role bindings within the cluster. In our tests, this operation caused no downtime. Since the unmanaged AAD integration is deprecated on June 1, 2023, there is no chance to roll back.   Test Plan Test access to AKS cluster with admin account(in RES.Azure.KubeAdmin.Prod group), need update kubectl context and run “kubelogin convert-kubeconfig -l azurecli”.  Test access to AKS cluster with normal user account (NOT in RES.Azure.KubeAdmin.Prod group). need update kubectl context and run “kubelogin convert-kubeconfig -l azurecli”.   Test commands az account set --subscription d0179705-7e13-4ee7-9090-413f40013be5 az aks get-credentials --resource-group rg-devuat-aks-ause --name procare-aks-devuat-ause kubelogin convert-kubeconfig -l azurecli kubectl get deployments --all-namespaces=true Thanks.   Best regards,  Chunyuan Chen","0.5"
